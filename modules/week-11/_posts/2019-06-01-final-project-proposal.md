As we start to near the end of the term, it is time for you to start contemplating a final project for this course.

Your final project is an open, creative work, that you create, mix, and export. This project can be anything in the sonic art, sound, audio, or music based topics that we covered during the course this semester.

## Originality

The intent of this final project is for you to create an original sonic art work. Please use this as an opportunity to be creative, and to explore something that you have found interesting throughout this course.

## Deadlines

- Final Project Deadline:
	- Your final project will have three deadlines, a propsal draft(written or rough audio>), a audio rough drafty version. We will make comments and provide feedback after the proposal and first draft, and you will be expected to make appropriate adjustments and resubmit by the final version submission deadline.
		- 1st draft deadline: **{{ site.data.dates.1st_draft}}**
		- Final Version Deadline: **{{ site.data.dates.final_submission}}**
			- Please note: I will need to spend Wednesday during the day preparing your works for radio presentation that evening. As such, we CANNOT ACCEPT ANY LATE WORK FOR THIS DEADLINE. Failure to submit on time will result in a failing grade for the course.
	- This will allow me and the TA's to listen to each piece, to ensure that it is radio appropriate.
	- Likewise, I will be mastering all of your final works, so that they are at the appropriate loudness levels and sound like they "belong together".
- Final Project Proposal:
	- Your final project proposals are due: This coming **{{ site.data.dates.final_proposal}}**.


## Presentational Format

There are a number of factors for the final format for you to consider.

- Length:
	- 1 - 4 minutes.
	- Your final project can be anywhere between 1 and 4 minutes long.
- Copyright Material:
	- You must have all copyright for your work.
	- Since this will be broadcast on the radio, you must ensure that all source material and all aspects of the work are your own work
	- OR contain material that have copyrights allowing for re-use and distribution.
	- In other words, do not use any copyright material where you can not guarantee you are allowed to present it publicly.
- No Obscene, Profane, or Indecent material
	- You are not allowed to create works that contain obscene, profane, or indecent material.
		- For more on this, please read: [Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts - Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/obscene-indecent-and-profane-broadcasts)
	- This also means you must refrain from the "seven dirty words" and related terminology.

## Deliverables for Proposal

For this coming Monday, please submit the following:

1. A written description of what you propose to do for your final project.
2. (_optional_): A brief, proof-of-concept, or mock-up of what you are proposing
