For homework this week, you should create a piece that explores the tools and techniques introduced over the course of the past three weeks (Plug-Ins, Basics of Sound, Wave Types, Oscillators, Equalizers, and/or Delay).

More specifically though, you should find a way to incorporate and explore at least one instance of the tone generator and one instance of a delay plug-in. You should also consider recording something directly into Reaper on your computer, as one of the sound objects for your piece, but this is not required.

Artistically, you should be _exploring and playing_. Contemplate and push _how_ you can use these techniques. This should be fun, it is _play_ after all.

Your piece can be anywhere between 30 seconds and 4 minutes. You only need to submit the bounced sound file and a short description of how you approached your piece this week.

Please submit these to the week's content submission forum.

You should also listen to and comment on at least 3 of your colleagues resulting artworks.
