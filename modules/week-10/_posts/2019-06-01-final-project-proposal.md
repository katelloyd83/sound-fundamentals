As we start to near the end of the term, it is time for you to start contemplating a final project for this course.

Your final project is an open, creative work, that you create, mix, and export. This project can be anything in the sonic art, sound, audio, or music based topics that we covered during the course this semester.

## Originality

The intent of this final project is for you to create an original sonic art work. Please use this as an opportunity to be creative, and to explore something that you have found interesting throughout this course.

## Deadlines

- Final Project Deadline:
	- We are currently thinking final projects will be due: **Friday, April 9th**
	- This will allow me and the TA's to listen to each piece, to ensure that it is radio appropriate.
	- Likewise, I will be mastering all of your final works, so that they are at the appropriate loudness levels and sound like they "belong together".
- Final Project Proposal:
	- Your final project proposals are due: This coming **Friday, March, 26th**.

## Radio Show!

For the in-person version of this course, the end of the semester is marked by a public concert in which students present their final sonic artworks from the semester. Obviously, an in-person concert is not possible for the format of this course, nor in the times of COVID. Therefore, instead, the class will culminate with a radio festival presentation of your works.

We are currently planning for this to occur on Billy Kautz's show, "Something Else" on KGBA this April. If you don't already, you should obviously listen to [KGBA](https://www.kbga.org). Billy's show occurs on Wednesday evenings from 8-10pm. This show highlights experimental, avant-garde, electro-acoustic, jazz, creative music, and sonic art. For more information about this show, Billy, to see playlists from the show, or to hear old interviews conducted by Billy head to the following links:

## Presentational Format

As we are planning on radio presentations, there are a number of factors for the final format for you to consider.

- Length:
	- 1 - 4 minutes.
	- Your final project can be anywhere between 1 and 4 minutes long.
- Copyright Material:
	- You must have all copyright for your work.
	- Since this will be broadcast on the radio, you must ensure that all source material and all aspects of the work are your own work
	- OR contain material that have copyrights allowing for re-use and distribution.
	- In other words, do not use any copyright material where you can not guarantee you are allowed to present it publicly.
- No Obscene, Profane, or Indecent material
	- You are not allowed to create works that contain obscene, profane, or indecent material.
		- For more on this, please read: [Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts - Federal Communications Commission](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/obscene-indecent-and-profane-broadcasts)
	- This also means you must refrain from the "seven dirty words" and related terminology.

## Deliverables for Proposal

For this coming Friday, please submit the following:

1. A written description of what you propose to do for your final project.
2. (_optional_): A brief, proof-of-concept, or mock-up of what you are proposing

We will review these proposals and respond IF we see any problems or concerns. If you do not hear from us, please proceed with your project.

_If you have questions, need ideas, or have concerns, please setup an [office hours appointment with me](https://calendly.com/michael-musick/).
