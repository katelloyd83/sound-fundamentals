## Teaching Assistant/s

In addition to myself, we will be supported with two teaching assistants this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Moodle forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.

Additionally, these TAs will be available for video meetings to assist with problems.
