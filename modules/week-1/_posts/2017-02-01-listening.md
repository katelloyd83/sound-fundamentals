# What does it mean _to listen?_

**_{ TODO: }_**

- Please either open a new note on your computer, text document on your computer, or grab a piece of paper and a writing utensil.
- Take 10 minutes to contemplate what it means _"to listen"_.
- At the end of 10 minutes, write any thoughts, working definitions, or notes you have on this idea.
- Save this writing for later.

## Listening vs. Hearing

_Listening_ is something that we, as humans, _do_ through our sense of hearing. We will discuss this in more depth later in the semester, but as sound waves reach our ears, the physical movement of our ear drums starts a process that results in tiny hair cell receptors in our inner-ear sending electrical signals to our brain indicating the presence of specific frequencies at various amplitudes or loudness.

Our sense of hearing is what allows us to _listen_ to what is occurring around us. Hearing is the physical act of processing physical sound in our environment. Hearing is something that most peoples bodies do _ALL OF THE TIME_. Unlike the eye, humans cannot turn off their sense of hearing. As many have pointed out, you cannot "blink an ear".

> "The blink of an eye lasts three hundred milliseconds. The blink of an ear lasts considerably longer. From birth to death, the ear never closes. "

We are always hearing. Even when we sleep, sound waves still pass into our ears, and vibrate our ear drums. Our sense of hearing serves many functions, including protection and safety through this "always on" approach.

So, if _hearing_ is the physiological act of sensing sound, **_listening_ is the cognitive act of _making meaning of the sounds we hear_**.

## Listening Requires Work

Listening requires active work and focus. As an example, _Listening_ is recognizing that a sound is coming from behind you, and is most likely a tree creaking in the wind. _Listening_ is deciphering someones voice and understanding that they are telling you "I love you".

_Listening_ requires that a person spends mental energy making meaning of the sounds they perceive through hearing.

> “Hearing is something that happens to us because we have ears – it is our primary sense organ. Listening is something we develop and cultivate our whole life, and maybe all of our lifetimes. Listening is what creates culture. Listening is very diverse and takes many forms as cultures take many forms.”
> – [Pauline Oliveros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Oliveros), from _Deep Listening: A Composer’s Sound Practice_, 2005.
