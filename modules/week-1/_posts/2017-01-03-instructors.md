Quick links, including email links, office hours, and lab hours, are all available from the ["Instructors"]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/) tab above in the course menubar.

What follows is a more detailed introduction to the people delivering this class to you this semester. We are a team, and will be working together to deliver this experience to you.

## Michael Musick

This course was disigned by Dr. Michael Musick. However, he is on leave this semester and I am happily the instructor of record. If you have any significant problems, administrative or technical, you will need to come to me about them.

I am excited to work with you, and guide you through the journey introducing you to Sound Production & Design!

Please feel free to leverage my in-person or virtual office hours. I would love it if each and everyone of you would create an appointment to meet with me in the first few weeks to introduce yourself. Although I do not have an office on campus, I am happy to meet in the UC or Library,McGill computer lab just email me.  I'm also available via Zoom. 

For anyone wanting to setup an appointment immediately, please feel free to stop by my in person office hours, or setup a Zoom meeting right now!


> # Bio

Kate Lloyd is a second-year graduate student in the Media Arts department. I have over 15 years of experience working in the performing arts: as a touring musician, stagecraft for theater, field recordist and sound designer for film, a foley artist for live broadcasting, and a technical director. I've also served as an audio/lighting engineer for live music production venues.

Current Work & Research @ UM: I currently serve as the Sound Studio Manager and assistant to the media equipment room.

Last fall, I was the production manager and recording/mixing engineer for the University Graduate School Podcast, "Confluence," where I also specialized in soundscapes for sound design.
My current research interests include sound for games, immersive audio, and mobile applications for mental health.

## Teaching Assistants

In addition to myself, we will be supported with a teaching assistant this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course Moodle forum (more to come on that later), you should e-mail a TA for help.

Additionally, these TAs will be available for video meetings to assist with problems.
